    "description": "<br/> \nActivation date: 2017-03-08 <br/> \nEvent type: Other <br/> \n <br/> \nActivation reason:  <br/> \nPost-disaster situation analyses of the flood that occurred in mid-March 2017 in Lima, Peru. Heavy rains affected nearly all of Peru leading to catastrophic flooding and landslides. In northern Lima, flooded areas along R&iacute;mac and Chill&oacute;n rivers were reported.The scope of the map production is to generate a pre-event reference content, delineate the event impact and grade the damage, focusing on people and assets, with particular attention to schools in the metropolitan area&nbsp; of northern Lima.The results of this activation are to support School Safety &ndash; a UNESCO project. It aims to empower schools and their communities in the identification of hazard and risks they are the most exposed to, their vulnerabilities and their capacity to manage them.Land Use Land Cover Map of Lima metropolitan areaThe metropolitan area of Lima lacked public datasets with basic information. EMSN038 contributed to the generation of some of this information, such as the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) layer classified following a standard legend such as Corine Land Cover level 3 and at a very ambitious scale: 1:15,000.The LULC layer was generated based on urban atlas methodology, using the transportation network skeleton to delimitate urban enclosures. The classification was performed by photointerpretation of SPOT 7 pre-event imagery.Flood ExtentThe main areas where evidence of flooding&nbsp; were detected in the post-event WorldView-2 images are along R&iacute;mac River, running east to west in the southern part of the AOI. The area of Carapongo/Santa Mar&iacute;a de Huachipa is the largest one of these. Second largest area is Cajamarquilla, located to the north of Carapongo area, upstream of Huaycoloro. Smaller affected areas were detected along Chill&oacute;n River at San Mart&iacute;n de Porres, Comas, Puente de Piedra, Sol de Carabayllo and la Rinconada Condominium.Damage assessment of flood impactThe damage assessment tasks focused on flood detectiio and grading the impact of flooding on assets and population. The visual inspection in search of damage was performed &nbsp;along the course of the main rivers of the AOI (Chill&oacute;n, R&iacute;mac and Huaycoloro) using WorldView-2 post-event imagery from 18/03/2017 and 21/03/2017. The assessment focused on the potentially flooded areas detected in the flood delineation task. It was possible to observe the damage reported on items of news found on internet, where images taken on the ground confirm the magnitude of the observed impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/> \n <br/>",
