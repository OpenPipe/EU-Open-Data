    "description": "Information on meetings held by the Head of Service for Foreign Policy Instruments (FPI) with organisations and self-employed individuals. Data include date of the meeting, location, name of the Head of Service, name of the organisation or self-employed individual and subject. The dataset is updated within a period of two weeks following the meeting. \r\n\r\nThe Service for Foreign Policy Instruments supports the EU to achieve its foreign and security policy objectives, in particular with regards to peace and conflict prevention, and to project the EU's interests and image in the world. Working in a wide range of areas with various partners and stakeholders FPI contributes to the achievement of the EU's general objective to become 'a stronger global actor'.\r\n\r\nTo achieve its objective, FPI is responsible for the operational and financial management of the budgets for Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP), Partnership Instrument (PI), Election Observation Missions (EOMs), Press and Public Diplomacy (PPD) as well as the implementation of Foreign Policy Regulatory Instruments (sanctions, the Kimberley Process on conflict diamonds and the Anti-Torture Regulation). \r\n\r\nFPI delivers on its objectives in an open and accountable fashion.",
