    "description": "EPILOBEE was the first active epidemiological surveillance program implemented in 17 EU Member States, over 2 consecutive years (from autumn 2012 to summer 2014), following a harmonised protocol based on the EU reference laboratory guidelines. EFSA requested a statistical analysis  on the EPILOBEE dataset to establish  associations between colony mortalities and some factors including disease prevalence, the context of beekeeping and the apiary geographical distribution.The data set published  is the result of the data cleaning and categorization performed on the EPILOBEE original dataset regarding seasonal mortality. The dataset comprises 4758  observations from apiaries across Europe.\r\n\r\nThe present dataset has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.
