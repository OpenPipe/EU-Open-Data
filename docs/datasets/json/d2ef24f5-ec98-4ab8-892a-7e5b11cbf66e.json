    "description": "<br/> \nActivation date: 2017-09-25 <br/> \nEvent type: Other <br/> \n <br/> \nActivation reason:  <br/> \nPre-disaster situation analyses for four locations in Italy: Priolo (Sicilia), Otranto (Puglia), Metaponto (Basilicatta) and Catanzaro Lido (Calabria). All of the AOIs are located on the coast, on the front line of any eventual tsunami. A correct and detailed capture of assets was essential in order to improve and perform detailed response and evacuation programs and&nbsp;&nbsp;in order to minimize casualties in a disaster situation.The scope of the map production is to generate a pre-event reference content and analyses including hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk relating to a Tsunami event. Secondary risks are also considered. Access and evacuation routes as well as mitigation measures with respect to all evaluated risks are proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;EMSN043 results will support the current work of the Italian Civil Protection Department to set up the national early warning system, and help the local administrative authorities in charge of planning.Vulnerability of AssetsThe assessment of vulnerability of assets was based on published bibliography and focused on building features and their attributes. Building footprints had to be digitized using pre-event reference imagery and the attributes related to visible characteristics of buildings coded to assess their vulnerability. Building features used in the assessment are related to physical attributes: number of floors, building materials, shape and orientation and presence of natural or artificial protective barriers. These attributes were translated into scores that are used to determine building vulnerability, structural vulnerability, and the vulnerability of building elements.Evacuation Routes for populationThe identification of potential suitable locations for emergency management activities (evacuation points, safe shelters, and field hospitals, helicopter landing spots, gasoline tanks and communications systems) was performed using a spatial multi criteria analysis and the evacuation routes for population from the affected areas to the safe shelters and the access for emergency and rescue services were calculated using network analysis. Their service areas were calculated based on the road network in terms of distance: 500, 1000 and 1500 metres.Mitigation MeasuresHard structural measures were avoided as much as possible, in order to acheive the optimum&nbsp;&nbsp;environmental integration and taking into consideration the sustainability of the measures. These measures were proposed in the form of structural reinforcements where they already exist (harbours and structures protecting the refinery in Priolo). Some other measures imply public works (rising of road profiles), but their environmental impact is compatible, as the infrastructure already existed.&nbsp; <br/> \n <br/>",
