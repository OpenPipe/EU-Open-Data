    "description": "<br/> \nActivation date: 2018-02-06 <br/> \nEvent type: Flood <br/> \n <br/> \nActivation reason:  <br/> \nThis activation focuses on post-disaster situation analysis, concerning flood events that occurred from January 18 to January 22, 2017, within two main Sardinia&rsquo;s rivers&#39;&nbsp;flows (Tirso and Cedrino).More specifically it addresses the evaluation of flood risk and related impacts on the use of soil, structure and infrastructure.Flooding At Peak Conditions - Damage AssessmentObserved flood extent mapping was estimated using the available SAR imagery for the Orosei sub AOI, which covered the period between January 4th and January 28th, including pre, peak and post images. This specific layer was used as an input for the modelling of the maximum flood extent product.&nbsp;Damage assessment for the population and POIs for the Orosei AOI, subsequent to the events of January 2017 was evaluated using the RASOR platform (www.rasor.eu).&nbsp;Flood Risk Assessment&nbsp;Hazard&nbsp;maps were directly derived from the official maps of the Piano dell&rsquo;Assetto Idrogeologico (PAI) of the Sardinia Region.The&nbsp;exposure&nbsp;layer was generated automatically, by overlaying the hazard layer with detailed information on population and assets, transportation network, POIs &amp; LULC.The&nbsp;vulnerability&nbsp;assessment of the exposed elements was calculated by considering specific criteria that characterize flood vulnerability and distinguish urban from non-urban areas.Analytical statistics, displaying the severity of the potential impact to assets and population were also calculated and provided.Transportation Network&nbsp;Vulnerability to disruption&nbsp;was estimated taking into account the following parameters:\u2219&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road capacity inferred by the respective taxonomy (highway, primary, secondary, etc.)\u2219&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proximity to populated places\u2219&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population (residents)\u2219&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of alternative routesThe vulnerability of disruption was estimated for each transport asset and segmented into five discrete classes; very low, low, medium, high and very high. <br/> \n <br/>",
