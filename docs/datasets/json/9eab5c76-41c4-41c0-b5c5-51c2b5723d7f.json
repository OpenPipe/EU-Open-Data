    "description": "<br/> \nActivation date: 2018-03-30 <br/> \nEvent type: Other <br/> \n <br/> \nActivation reason:  <br/> \nThe purpose of the requested mapping is to generate comprehensive knowledge through performing pre-disaster situation analysis, concerning a potential eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano located near to Goma, capital of North Kivu province in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo&nbsp;(DRC).The results refer to background information as well as to the assessment of the impact of a potential volcano activity on the surrounding urban agglomerations and infrastructures; detailed Digital Elevation Model (DEM), hazard, exposure and vulnerability. These products intend to support informed decision making of the involved stakeholders with reference to disaster preparedness and disaster management. An evacuation plan has also been produced.The key user of the geospatial information and the related map series is DG ECHO, Emergency Response and Coordination center (ERCC).The DEM product was generated through adequately processing of monostatic Tandem-X couples and a Pleiades panchromatic stereo-pair. The products obtained from SAR and optical data processing, were then fused, using weighting parameters, calculated during the generation process. The result was a detailed DEM with 5 meter grid spacing and a vertical accuracy in Z of 3 meters.DEM&nbsp;The Lava Flow Hazard assessment was determined by performing data analysis based on modified and extended implementations of (i) the QVAST tool for the estimation of volcanic susceptibility and (ii) the Q-LavHa tool for the estimation of the lava flow paths and their convergence, by exploiting probabilistic and deterministic simulation models for evaluating channelled lava flow inundation probabilities from regularly distributed eruptive vents. The processing involved: (i) the study of the historical volcanic activity of the area (analysis of historic eruption fissure and vent locations), (ii) Calculation of a volcanic eruption susceptibility map, obtained through a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) on the basis of Probability Density Function (PDF) Maps and definition of the possible lava eruption areas and (iii) Per pixel (DEM) estimation of lava inundation probability (Q-LavHa tool models).Lava flow hazard map&nbsp;The Transportation Network Vulnerability to disruption was estimated on the basis of (a) the Road capacity, as inferred by the respective taxonomy and (b) the population density.Transportation Network Vulnerability to disruption&nbsp; <br/> \n <br/>",
