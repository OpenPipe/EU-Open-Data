Among the more interesting findings are the perception of strong social support networks across Europe, the differences in levels of satisfaction both within and between countries, and the variation in perceived sources of tension in EU countries. Another key finding is the significant impact of social circumstances on perceived quality of life \u2013 for example, the strong influence that individual income levels, as well as national prosperity levels, appear to have on subjective well-being.",

Central to this analysis is describing how the characteristics of the work situation affect people\u2019s subjective life satisfaction. In doing so, the report reaches some significant conclusions, in particular the strong correlation between working conditions and job satisfaction, which in turn is shown to affect people\u2019s overall life satisfaction.",

It finds that, in addition to living space and standard of accommodation, quality of life is largely dependent on factors such as personal safety, proximity to local infrastructure and the quality of the environment such as clear water, clean air and green areas.",
