    "description": "Survey results are based on the responses from 5,847 self-identified Jewish respondents (aged 16 or over) living in one of eight EU Member States \u2013 Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom for their opinions and perceptions on antisemitic trends and antisemitism as a problem in everyday life. The respondents were also asked to describe their personal experiences of antisemitic incidents, witnessing antisemitic incidents and worrying about being a victim of an antisemitic attack (affecting their personal safety, safety of children, or other family members and friends). The survey also provides data on whether the occurrence of antisemitic acts against the Jewish community, such as vandalism of Jewish sites or antisemitic messages in the broadcast media or in the internet, is considered to be a problem in their countries by the Jewish respondents.",
