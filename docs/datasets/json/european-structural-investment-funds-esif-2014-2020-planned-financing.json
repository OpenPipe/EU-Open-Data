    "description": "This dataset provides information on planned financing under the different ESI Funds (2014-2020). The data is taken from the adopted financial tables (as available by February 2017) and is broken down by fund, programme, priority axis, thematic objective and category of region (more developed, less developed, etc. where available). \r\nFor ERDF, ESF and CF the \"priority\" columns relate to the priority axis (financing blocks) in the programmes; the \"investment priority\" related to the fixed lists of defined investment objectives set in the three specific fund Regulations. \r\nFor the European Agricultural fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) detail is also provided by EAFRD \"Focus areas\" and \"Measures\" (the EAFRD Focus Areas are detailed in the EAFRD fund Regulation - Article 5 and the EAFRD measures in Article 13-40 of the relevant Implementing Regulation ). \r\nThe data now covers 533 programmes available (adopted and draft) as available by February 2017 and includes the EU and national co-financing covered by the adoption decision. Financial allocations in the programme financial table may change over time (i.e. transfers between themes, between funds) and as a result the dataset will be updated regularly.\r\n\r\nhttps://cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/\r\n",
