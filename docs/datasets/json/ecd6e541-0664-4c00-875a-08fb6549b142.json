    "description": "<br/> \nActivation date: 2018-04-25 <br/> \nEvent type: Storm <br/> \n <br/> \nActivation reason:  <br/> \nThe purpose of the requested mapping is to generate comprehensive knowledge through performing post-disaster situation analysis concerning hurricane Irma (September 2017) over two Caribbean islands: the French part of Saint Martin and Saint Barth&eacute;lemy (FR).Towards the implementation of adequate recovery activities, efficient support and informed decision making of the involved stakeholders, damage assessment and reconstruction mapping was performed. The first monitoring exercise refers to the beginning of March 2018.The reconstruction monitoring will continue throughout 2018 (stage 2) and 2019 (stage 3).&nbsp;Related products will become available in due time.Key users of the geospatial information and the related map series are the Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale De La S&eacute;curit&eacute; Civile et de la Gestion Des Crises, and the Minist&egrave;re des Outre-mer, D&eacute;l&eacute;gation interminist&eacute;rielle.The reference map shows background information of the AOIs, including physiography, transportation infrastructure, built up areas, commercial, public and private services, etc. The information was generated/updated through photo interpretation of the available orthophotos and further elaborated through using VHR satellite imagery.&nbsp; &nbsp;Reference mapA Land Use/Land Cover map was created. The legend is based upon CORINE level 4 categories within the built-up areas and level 3 categories within the remaining areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Land Use/ Land Cover mapThe Damage Assessment map shows the damaged assets, which were assigned a damage severity rate (four categories). In order to establish the damage rate, comparative photo interpretation of optical VHR satellite data, acquired before and after the event, was applied. The evaluation of damage was based upon the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS), 1998, and the JRC damage grading nomenclatures, through accounting for specific characteristics, e.g. the roof conditions, the surrounding area status (fences, vegetation, vehicles and wrecks) and the presence of debris.&nbsp; &nbsp;Damage Assessment mapThe Reconstruction Monitoring map (March 2018) is the first of a time series of maps showing the status of reconstruction of the damaged assets in March 2018. To establish the reconstruction rate of the assets, the analysis accounted for indications of interventions such as debris clearance, building demolition, construction activities, new structures, etc. The reconstruction status was assigned per asset on the basis of a comparative photo interpretation using two dates of optical VHR satellite data.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reconstruction Monitoring map (March 2018) <br/> \n <br/>",
