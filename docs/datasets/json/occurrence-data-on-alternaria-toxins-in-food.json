    "description": "Alternaria toxins are mycotoxins produced by Alternaria species that cause plant diseases on many\u00a0crops. They are the principal contaminating fungi in wheat, sorghum and barley, and have also been\u00a0reported to occur in oilseeds such as sunflower and rapeseed, tomato, apples, citrus fruits, olives and\u00a0several other fruits and vegetables. In addition, some Alternaria\u00a0toxins are genotoxic in vitro and/or fetotoxic in rats. This published dataset contains data related to\u00a0years 1995, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2008 and 2009. Occurrence data\u00a0were received from two Member States, which provided 11,730\u00a0occurrence results in food, and complemented with\u00a0data published in the scientific literature. This data has been used for the preparation of the Scientific Opinion on the risks for animal and public health related to the\u00a0presence of Alternaria toxins in feed and food adopted in 2011.\r\n\r\nSeveral chromatography-based techniques are suitable for Alternaria toxin quantification in foods and\u00a0feeds, and liquid chromatography coupled to (tandem) mass spectrometry has become the method of\u00a0choice. The limiting factors for the analysis of Alternaria toxins are the\u00a0efficiency of sample cleanup, the availability of (sufficient) amounts of standards and the lack of\u00a0reference materials for food and feed. In the dataset published the following analytical methods have been used:\u00a0HPLC-RI; Chromatographic tests (Not Specified); HPLC-UV; Standard Chromatographic tests (paper- thin layer- and column chromatography); LC-MS-MS (QqQ); HPLC-HG-AFS.",
