    "description": "A subset of Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) data covering public procurement for the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from 2006-01-01 to 2017-12-31 in comma separated value format. This data includes the most important fields from the contract notice and contract award notice standard forms, such as who bought what from whom, for how much, and which procedure and award criteria were used.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the data consists of tenders above the procurement thresholds. However, publishing below threshold tenders in TED is considered good practice, and thus a non-negligible number of below threshold tenders is present as well.\r\n\r\nPlease see the document below for important information on the data and its usage, including a version history of the export.\r\n\r\nThe European Commission is interested in the results of research on public procurement coming from the re-use of this data. Thus, we will be grateful to receive links to any papers, reports, or applications at GROW-G4@ec.europa.eu. To support the exchange of ideas, especially between practitioners and academics, the Commission hosts an [open wiki] (https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=EPROC&title=TED+Open+Data+Wiki) with ideas for research questions and existing examples of reuse related to this dataset.\r\n\r\nTED with broader coverage is also available in XML format at https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/ted-1 .",
