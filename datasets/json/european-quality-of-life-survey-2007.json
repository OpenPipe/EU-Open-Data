            "description": "Just over 20% of Europeans take part in voluntary and charitable activities, though there are wide differences between Member States. The highest rates are seen in the Nordic Member States (Denmark, Finland, Sweden) and the lowest rates are in Bulgaria, Greece, Malta, Portugal, Romania and Spain. People with a high level of educational attainment are more likely to be volunteers, as are those who attend religious services regularly. Based on data from the second European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), conducted by Eurofound in 2007, this report examines the factors underpinning people\u2019s decision to volunteer, the amount of time devoted to volunteering among those who participate and whether participation is associated with greater life satisfaction. The study also looks at unpaid work (which includes caring and housework), the amount of time spent on it and the characteristics of those who do it frequently. ",

            "description": "Many European countries have seen high levels of immigration from all parts of the world in the past two decades and the population of visible minority ethnic groups has grown rapidly. This report presents the results of a research programme analysing the quality of life in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods in EU15 countries based on the 2007 European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS). The findings confirm that material poverty is often combined with higher degrees of social exclusion in such neighbourhoods. The perceived quality of life is also lower in these areas and in general they have higher levels of social tension. From a policy point of view, this underlines the need for an integrated and comprehensive social and housing policy intervention in affected high-diversity neighbourhoods, with strong involvement of local communities.
