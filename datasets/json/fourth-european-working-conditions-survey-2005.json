In this context, the Foundation\u2019s European Working Conditions Surveys, conducted every five years, have been providing a valuable insight into key aspects of work since 1990. This report analyses the findings of the fourth survey, carried out in autumn 2005 across 31 countries, including the 27 EU Member States. Based on workers\u2019 responses, it paints a broad and varied picture of the physical, intellectual and psychological dimensions of work and its impact on personal fulfilment and work-life balance.",
