    "description": "This dataset provides the indicative list of major projects from the ERDF and Cohesion Fund programmes 2014-2020 and provides details on the projects then presented for the approval of the Commission. \r\n\r\n\u2018Major Projects\u2019 are usually large-scale infrastructure projects in the transport and environment sectors, but some may also involve investments in the energy, research, ICT and other sectors supported by the ERDF or the Cohesion Fund. The total eligible cost of such projects is more than \u20ac 50 million (\u20ac 75m for transport and energy networks under Thematic Objectives 7 - Transport and other strategic networks). Due to their importance the planned major projects are specifically listed in the Operational Programmes and are then subject to an assessment and a specific approval by the European Commission on the basis of documentation including Cost-Benefit Analysis and feasibility studies. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate their assessment various procedures for sending major projects to the Commission are provided for. (There are separate procedures for projects phased between different financing periods). The Member States are recommended to use independent experts (from the JASPERS initiative) to appraise their projects.\r\n\r\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/projects/major/\r\n",
