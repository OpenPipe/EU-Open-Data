The DATA Unit supported this activity by estimating the nutrient intake of a number of micronutrients in nine selected European countries and different age groups. In addition, the DATA Unit also provided information on average content of food sources of the respective nutrients per country based on the composition database, as well as main food group contributors to nutrient intakes and assessed the comparability of the provided data with pertinent published intake data.\r\n\r\nIntake estimates have been assessed using food consumption data from the EFSA Comprehensive Food Consumption Database (EFSA, 2011a) and the EFSA Nutrient composition database. Food composition data used to populate the Nutrient composition database were provided to EFSA through the EFSA procurement project \u2018Updated food composition database for nutrient intake\u2019 (Roe at al., 2013). Data were provided following the EFSA specification for standard sample description for food and feed and were classified according to the FoodEx2 classification system of EFSA (EFSA, 2011b).\r\n\r\nThe food composition data used in these assessments and here published cover the following vitamins and minerals: calcium (Ca); copper (Cu); cobalamin (vitamin B12); magnesium (Mg); niacin; phosphorus (P); potassium (K); riboflavin; thiamin; iron (Fe); selenium (Se); vitamin B6; vitamin K, zinc (Zn), and vitamin E(1).
