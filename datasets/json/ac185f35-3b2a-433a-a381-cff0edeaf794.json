    "description": "<br/> \nActivation date: 2018-07-27 <br/> \nEvent type: Flood <br/> \n <br/> \nActivation reason:  <br/> \nThe activation focuses on two flood disaster management levels.The first refers to post\u2010disaster situation analysis concerning the impact of intense rain (16 December 2017) over the Villa Santa Lucia, in the commune of Chait&eacute;n, Chile (CL).Mudflow Delineation - Damage AssessmentComprehensive knowledge of the disaster is provided through a number of information layers, as is the spatial extent of the flood/ landslide (mudslide) caused by the rainfall, the impact on population and assets, as well as information on Land Use/Cover and existing assets and infrastructures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second refers to the efficient support of flood risk management activities and planning of prevention, protection and preparedness measures through accounting for the areas characteristics.Flood Risk Mapping - Population at RiskTowards reducing the adverse consequences of flooding for both population and economic activity (pre-disaster) flood risk assessment was implemented within a large area: the valleys connecting Futaleuf&uacute;, Palena, Villa Vanguardia, Villa Santa Lucia and Puerto C&aacute;rdenas.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Hazard&nbsp;layer is based on the Flood Susceptibility Index, calculated from the DEM according to Samela, C., Troy, T. J., &amp; Manfreda, S. (2017). Geomorphic classifiers for flood-prone area delineation for data-scarce environments. Advances in Water Resources, 102, 13-28.Exposure&nbsp;is defined on the basis of Asset Category in the areas located inside a flood hazard area. To each category a specific level of vulnerability is assigned.The&nbsp;vulnerability&nbsp;assessment of the exposed elements was calculated by considering specific criteria that characterize flood vulnerability and distinguish urban from non-urban areas.The&nbsp;risk&nbsp;level is mapped combining hazard and vulnerability through specific lookup tables.Mitigation&nbsp;measures are defined in terms of level of risk for bridges, urban structural and non-structural measures and river structural measures.Flood Risk Mapping - Assets and Transportation Network at Risk&nbsp; <br/> \n <br/>",
